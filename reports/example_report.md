# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities have been identified in the scanned environment, primarily affecting the web server running on port 80. The most pressing issues include CVE-2020-1938 (TCP) and CVE-2012-1823 (HTTP). Additionally, SQL injection attempts were unsuccessful but may indicate potential security gaps.

# CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

## CVE-2020-1938
- **Vulnerability Name**: [CVE-2020-1938](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1938)
- **Affected Component**: TCP
- **Technical Description**: The system is vulnerable to a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the `libssh` library. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

## CVE-2012-1823
- **Vulnerability Name**: [CVE-2012-1823](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1823)
- **Affected Component**: HTTP
- **Technical Description**: The server is vulnerable to a high-severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability due to the use of `allow_url_include` and `auto_prepend_file`. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by including malicious PHP files from an arbitrary URL, resulting in RCE.

# ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Update libssh library**: Upgrade the affected system's `libssh` library to the latest stable version and apply any available patches to mitigate the risk of CVE-2020-1938 exploitation.

2. **Secure PHP configuration**: Disable the `allow_url_include` directive in your PHP configuration file (php.ini) or use a more restrictive setting, such as only allowing local files to be included. Additionally, remove any unnecessary use of `auto_prepend_file`.

# SECURITY GAPS & WEAKNESSES

- **SQL Injection Attempts**: Though unsuccessful in this instance, the SQLMAP scan suggests that there may be potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. It is recommended to review your database code and implement proper input validation to prevent such attacks.
